# Vulpstation
Vulpstation is an attempt to revive Floofstation, a recently closed down SS14 server.

[Floof Station](https://github.com/floof-station/floof-station) was a fork of [Einstein-Engines](https://github.com/Simple-Station/Einstein-Engines).

## Building

Refer to [the Space Wizards' guide](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/setup/setting-up-a-development-environment.html) on setting up a development environment and for general information. But do keep in mind that Einstein Engines, the codebase Floof Station is based on, is an alternative codebase to the base one provided by WizDen, and many things may thus not apply nor be the same.
We provide some scripts shown below to make the job easier.
